TIMMING CACHE AND BUFFERD

timing cached reads:This displays the speed of reading directly from the Linux buffer cache without disk access. 
This measurement is essentially an indication of the throughput of the processor, cache, and memory of the system under test


timing buffered: This displays the speed of reading through the buffer cache to the disk without any prior caching of data. 
This measurement is an indication of how fast the drive can sustain sequential data reads under Linux, without any filesystem overhead.
The disk buffer is controlled by the microcontroller in the hard disk drive


SDD
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   13212 MB in  2.00 seconds = 6613.64 MB/sec  
 Timing buffered disk reads: 1478 MB in  3.00 seconds = 492.30 MB/sec
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   13134 MB in  2.00 seconds = 6574.53 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 1478 MB in  3.00 seconds = 492.42 MB/sec


HDD
root@delltest:/home/whuser# hdparm -Tt /dev/sdb

/dev/sdb:
 Timing cached reads:   13152 MB in  2.00 seconds = 6583.48 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 616 MB in  3.01 seconds = 204.88 MB/sec

/dev/sdb:
 Timing cached reads:   12996 MB in  2.00 seconds = 6505.61 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 620 MB in  3.00 seconds = 206.51 MB/sec



AVG WRITE (DD METHOD)
This tells dd to require a complete “sync” once, right before it exits. 
So it commits the whole 10GB of data, then tells the operating system: “OK, now ensure this is completely on disk”, 
only then measures the total time it took to do all that and calculates the benchmark result. REALISTIC
